The financial statement is divided into four categories: balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and statement of stakeholder equity. The balance sheet refers to what a company owns and owes at a fixed point of time such as assets, liability, and equity. The income statement refers to the company’s profits and losses over a while.
The cash flow statement enlists the records of money exchange between the company and the outer world. The last statement, the statement of stake- holder equity states the change in the interest of the company’s stakeholders over a while. So, it is not easy to extract financial documents manually.
